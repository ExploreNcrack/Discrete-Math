# Eight Coin Problem
There are 8 coins, all identical except that one is **slightly heavier or slightly lighter** than the others.
</br>
Find the counterfeit using three weighings on a pan balance.

# Solution
This problem is slightly different than the Nine-Coin problem
</br>**Since the condition about whether the counterfeit coin is heavier than the others or lighter than the others is not known in this case.**
