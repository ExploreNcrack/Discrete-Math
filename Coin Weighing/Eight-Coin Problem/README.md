# Eight Coin Problem
There are 8 coins, all identical except that one is **slightly heavier or slightly lighter** than the others.
</br>
Find the counterfeit using three weighings on a pan balance.

# Solution
This problem is slightly different than the Nine-Coin problem
</br>**Since the condition about whether the counterfeit coin is heavier than the others or lighter than the others is not known in this case.(which means we have to assume both cases counterfeit coin is slightly heavier or slightly lighter)**
</br>
</br>Just like the Nine-Coin problem, apply divide and conquer method to split the coins
