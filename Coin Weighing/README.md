## Definition 1: 
An  ***adaptive solution*** is a step by step solution where at each step we adapt depending upon the outcome of previous steps.

notation for finding an adaptive solution:
* "o" be a coin with an unknown weight
* "H" be a coin that might be too heavy but is not too light
* "L" be a coin that might be too light but is not too heavy
* "arrow L" represent the case when the scale tips to the left
* "arrow R" represent the case when the scale tips to the right
* "arrow B" represent the case when the scale balances
