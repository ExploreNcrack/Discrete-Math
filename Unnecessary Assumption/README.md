# Unnecessary Assumption
**When you are trying to solve a problem, 
you are sometimes hindered because you apply assumptions that are not part of the problem.**
Some of those problem can be easily solved once you get rid of the **unnecessary assumption**
## Example
One night my uncle was reading an exciting book when his wife turned out the light. Even though the room was pitch-dark he went right on reading. How could he do that?
</br>
</br>
Most of us, when we look at this problem, we will automatically assume that the uncle was a  **sighted person**.
</br>This will result you to think in a wrong way of searching for a possible solution that can satisfy the constraints.
</br>And it seems like there is no such solution can possibly exist or the statement/question itself has a problem.
</br>Just becasue we have added the "unnecessary assumption" that the uncle is a sighted person.
</br>Indeed the statement above does not even depict such characteristic for uncle.
</br>Once we get rid of the assumption that the uncle is a sighted person. **(Or the uncle could be a blind person)**
</br>The problem begin to unravel
</br>The uncle can keep reading book even without the light's on is because the uncle may be a blind person and he is reading Braille(a form of written language for blind people, in which characters are represented by patterns of raised dots that are felt with the fingertips.).
