# Modular Arithmetic


In mathematics, modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers, 
where numbers "wrap around" upon reaching a certain valueâ€”the modulus (plural moduli).

Modular arithmetic can be handled mathematically by introducing a **congruence relation** on the integers that is compatible with the operations on integers: addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
