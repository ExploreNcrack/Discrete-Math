# Modular Arithmetic


In mathematics, modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers, 
where numbers **"wrap around"** upon reaching a certain value—the modulus (plural moduli).
 [[wiki]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic)

Modular arithmetic can be handled mathematically by introducing a **congruence relation** on the integers that is compatible with the operations on integers: **addition, subtraction, and multiplication**. 

A **congruence relation** (or simply congruence) is an **equivalence relation** on an algebraic structure (such as a group, ring, or vector space) that is compatible with the structure.

## Division Theorem (Division of Integer)
For every pair of integers 𝑎 and 𝑚 with 𝑚 > 0 there exist unique integers 𝑞 and 𝑟 such that:                                                                      
**a = mq + r**  and **0≤r<|m|**
